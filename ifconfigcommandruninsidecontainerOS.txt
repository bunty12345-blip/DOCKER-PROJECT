Inside the new container OS launched from docker hub  image we cant run the ifconfig command file.
Since it do not have net-tools software installed.
Inside the container:
# cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
# ls
check the repo file
# cd
Install net-tools software
# yum install net-tools 
Now the ifconfig command works
# ifconfig
