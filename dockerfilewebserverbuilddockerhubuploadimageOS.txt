How to build a webserver in docker file:
Step 1:  First Create a directory
# mkdir/test
# cd/test
Step 2: Create a file name "Dockerfile"
# touch /test/Dockerfile
Step 3: Design a sample html webpage eg : "sujayshankarbiswas.html"
# vim  /test/sujayshankarbiswas.html
Step 4: Edit the file using the following instructions:
 # vi Dockerfile
FROM centos:latest
MAINTAINER NewstarCorporation
RUN yum -y install httpd
COPY sujayshankarbiswas.html /var/www/html
CMD [“/usr/sbin/httpd”, “-D”, “FOREGROUND”]
EXPOSE 80
STEP 5 : Build the image using docker build . Test is the directory where Dockerfile is present and -t option is to tag or name the image.
# docker build /test/ -t webserver:v1
The webserver is successfully build.
Now upload the webserver to docker hub account :
1. Login to docker hub and create your own public repository so that people can access your account and download your webserver image that you upload on docker hub and run it and launch a new container OS
In linux commands
1. # docker login
give the username and password  of your docker hub account
After doing this :
2. Now push the webserver image to your docker hub acocunt
 # docker push username/webserver:v1
 https://hub.docker.com/r/bunty12345/webserver
docker pull bunty12345/webserver
The above two links will get you to the docker hub repo where you can download my images using docker pull command in your Linux OS.
